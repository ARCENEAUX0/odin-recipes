                                        <h3>Cooking Instructions</h3>
                                            <ol>
                                                <li>Reduce ¾ cup coconut milk until thick and coconut oil starts to
                                                    separate from the coconut milk (if the oil doesn’t separate after it has
                                                    reduced until very thick, it's okay, just proceed with the recipe).</li>
                                                <li>Add curry paste and sauté, stirring constantly over medium heat for
                                                    about 2 minutes until aromatic. If paste sticks to the bottom of the pan,
                                                    you can deglaze with a little bit of the remaining coconut milk.</li>
                                                <li>Add chicken thigh and stir to mix with the paste. (See below if using
                                                    chicken breast).</li>
                                                <li>Add kaffir lime leaves, chicken stock, remaining 1 cup of coconut
                                                    milk, palm sugar and 1 Tbsp fish sauce. Bring to a simmer and let
                                                    simmer gently for 10-15 minutes or until the chicken is fork tender.</li>
                                                <li>Once the curry is done simmering, add bamboo shoots and bring to a
                                                    boil. If you prefer your peppers to be more cooked, add them at this
                                                    stage. Once boiling, remove from heat.</li>
                                                <li>Taste and add more fish sauce and/or sugar as needed.</li>
                                                <li>Stir in Thai basil and spur chilies or bell peppers.</li>
                                                <li>Serve with jasmine rice</li>
                                            </ol>
