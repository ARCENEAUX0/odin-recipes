            <h3>Description</h3>
                <p>Green curry is the most popular and one of the most well-known dishes in Thai cuisine. The good news is that
                    it's very easy to make; and no, you do not need to make your own green curry paste from scratch
                    (most Thai people don't!)
                </p>
