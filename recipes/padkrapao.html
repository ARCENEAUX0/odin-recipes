            <h3>Description</h3>
                <p>In Thailand, this dish might be considered the equivalent of a sandwich or a burger.
                    Something quick, easy, and ubiquitous that lots of people have for lunch. You can find
                    pad gaprao at a simple street-side restaurant or in a food court, and many people
                    have it for lunch. Sometimes vendors will make it fresh for you, other times, you can
                    find it premade in a big tray and they just scoop it up and pour it over hot rice.
                </p>
                    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
                        <ul>
                            <li>5-10 Thai chilies, or to taste</li>
                            <li>5 cloves garlic</li>
                            <li>1 spur chilies or another mild, red pepper, chopped</li>
                            <li>½ cup long beans, cut into short pieces</li>
                            <li>½ small onion, diced</li>
                            <li>300g chicken, coarsely ground </li>
                            <li>1 Tbsp oyster sauce</li>
                            <li>1 Tbsp soy sauce</li>
                            <li>2 tsp fish sauce</li>
                            <li>1½ tsp black soy sauce (or sub dark soy sauce and reduce regular soy sauce to 2 tsp)</li>
                            <li>2 Tbsp water</li>
                            <li>1 ½ tsp sugar</li>
                            <li>1 ½  cup holy basil leaves, loosely packed</li>
                            <li>Vegetable oil, as needed </li>
                            <li>2-3 eggs (1 per person)</li>
                            <li>Jasmine rice for serving</li>
                            <li>Prik Nam Pla (condiment for seasoning the egg, optional): Mix together
                                some fish sauce, a squeeze of lime juice, chopped Thai chilies, and 
                                chopped garlic.</li>
                        </ul>
                                <p><strong>Note:</strong> If you don't have holy basil, Thai basil will work fine; however, I have 
                                    found that regular Italian basil actually has a more similar flavour to holy 
                                    basil than Thai basil does, so that will work as well!</p>
                                <p><strong>Tools needed:</strong>  A wok or a large skillet for the stir-fry. For the fried egg 
                                    you can use a wok or a small frying pan, and non-stick would be better so you 
                                    don't have to worry about the egg sticking.</p>
