            <h3>Description</h3>
                <p>In Thailand, this dish might be considered the equivalent of a sandwich or a burger.<br>
                    Something quick, easy, and ubiquitous that lots of people have for lunch. You can find<br>
                    pad gaprao at a simple street-side restaurant or in a food court, and many people<br>
                    have it for lunch. Sometimes vendors will make it fresh for you, other times, you can<br>
                    find it premade in a big tray and they just scoop it up and pour it over hot rice.
                </p>
                    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
                        <ul>
                            <li>5-10 Thai chilies, or to taste</li>
                            <li>5 cloves garlic</li>
                            <li>1 spur chilies or another mild, red pepper, chopped</li>
                            <li>½ cup long beans, cut into short pieces</li>
                            <li>½ small onion, diced</li>
                            <li>300g chicken, coarsely ground </li>
                            <li>1 Tbsp oyster sauce</li>
                            <li>1 Tbsp soy sauce</li>
                            <li>2 tsp fish sauce</li>
                            <li>1½ tsp black soy sauce (or sub dark soy sauce and reduce regular soy sauce to 2 tsp)</li>
                            <li>2 Tbsp water</li>
                            <li>1 ½ tsp sugar</li>
                            <li>1 ½  cup holy basil leaves, loosely packed</li>
                            <li>Vegetable oil, as needed </li>
                            <li>2-3 eggs (1 per person)</li>
                            <li>Jasmine rice for serving</li>
                            <li>Prik Nam Pla (condiment for seasoning the egg, optional): Mix together<br>
                                some fish sauce, a squeeze of lime juice, chopped Thai chilies, and <br>
                                chopped garlic.</li>
                        </ul>
                                <p><em>Note: If you don't have holy basil, Thai basil will work fine; however, I have <br>
                                    found that regular Italian basil actually has a more similar flavour to holy <br>
                                    basil than Thai basil does, so that will work as well!</em></p>
                                <p><strong>Tools needed:</strong>  A wok or a large skillet for the stir-fry. For the fried egg <br>
                                    you can use a wok or a small frying pan, and non-stick would be better so you <br>
                                    don't have to worry about the egg sticking.</p>    
                    <h3>Cooking Instructions</h3>
                        <ol>
                            <li>Pound Thai chilies into a fine paste.</li>

                            <li>In a wok or a large saute pan, saute the garlic-chili paste in a
                                little vegetable oil over medium high heat until the garlic starts
                                to turn golden.
                            </li>
                            <li>Add chicken and toss until they're no longer in big clumps.
                                Add the sauce and continue tossing until the chicken is almost
                                done.
                            </li>
                            <li>Add onions and long beans; toss until the chicken is done.</li>
                            <li>Remove from heat and stir in the holy basil.</li>
                            <li>Taste and adjust seasoning as needed.</li>
                        </ol>
                    <h3>For the fried egg:</h3>
                        <ol>
                            <li>Heat about 1 cm of vegetable oil in a small non-stick pan or wok<br>
                            over medium high heat.</li>
                            <li>Once the oil is hot (you want the oil very hot, especially if you like<br>
                            runny yolk), crack the egg directly into the pan and let it fry until the<br>
                            edges are browned and bubbly.</li>
                        </ol>
                        Serve the stir-fry over rice and top it with the fried egg. Drizzle a little of<br>
                        the prik nam pla over the egg and enjoy!
