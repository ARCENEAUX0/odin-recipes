            <h3>Description</h3>
                <p>Tom yum (ต้มยำ) is a type of Thai hot and sour soup where the iconic<br>
                    flavours come from 3 herbs: lemongrass, galangal, and makrut (kaffir)<br>
                    lime leaves. It can be made with any meat or seafood, even leftover cooked meats,<br>
                    but the most popular version is made with shrimp, i.e. tom yum goong ต้มยำกุ้ง<br>
                    (goong means shrimp).</p>

                        <h3>Cooking Instructions</h3>
                            <ol>
                                <li>Add the shrimp or chicken stock, lemongrass, makrut lime leaves,<br>
                                    galangal and chilies to the pot. Bring to a boil and let it boil for<br>
                                    about 5 minutes until you can smell the fragrance of the herbs from the pot.</li>
                                <li>When the soup is done simmering, add the oyster mushrooms,<br>
                                    and bring the soup back to a boil.</li>
                                <li>Once the soup comes back to a boil, add the shrimp and when the<br>
                                    soup just starts to bubble again, turn off the heat. Let the residual<br>
                                    heat of the soup cook the shrimp completely; another minute or<br>
                                    so. (If you're using very large shrimp, you may need to cook it<br>
                                    longer, but check first to avoid overcooking shrimp).</li>
                                <li>Add the lime juice, fish sauce, chili paste, and sugar and stir. Taste<br>
                                    and adjust the seasoning to your liking. (You may need to add a<br>
                                    little more sugar, depending on how sweet your brand of chili paste is.)</li>
                                <li>Garnish with cilantro leaves and serve with rice, or turn it into a<br>
                                    “Kuay Tiew Tom Yum” by pouring the soup over rice noodles for a<br>
                                    pho-style meal!</li>
